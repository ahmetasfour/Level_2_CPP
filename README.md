The Clean Code in C++ 
solve problem and algorithm 
The style used in this code emphasizes clarity and organization, making the logic easy to follow. By using meaningful names, structs for grouping related data, and enums for choice management, the code is both intuitive and self-documenting. Additionally, small, single-purpose functions improve readability and minimize complexity, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principleâ€”a hallmark of clean code practices.
